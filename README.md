# React-Cocktail
**Learning Project with React**

**Task was to understand the basic features of React using components,states,props, and an API. I used a Udemy course which was teaching me how to create a basic React Youtube app but customized it to talk to a Cocktail API DB. It is not mobile friendly or optimized, used as a learning experience to expand my knowledge on React.**

*  *Not mobile / responsive friendly. This was just to learn React and its basic principles.*
