# React-Cocktail
**Learning Project with React**

**Task was to understand the basic features of React using components,states,props, and an API. I used a Udemy course which was teaching me how to create a basic React Youtube app but customized it to talk to a Cocktail API DB. From there I created a npm package to talk to the Cocktail DB. https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ https://www.npmjs.com/package/cocktail-api-search  It is not mobile friendly or optimized, used as a learning experience to expand my knowledge on React. **

*  *Not mobile / responsive friendly. This was just to learn React and its basic principles.*
