# React-Cocktail
**Learning Project with React**

**Task was to understand the basic features of React using components,states,props, and an API. I used a Udemy course which was teaching me how to create a basic React Youtube app but customized it to talk to a Cocktail API DB. From there I created a npm package to communicate to the Cocktail DB API to help others and automate this task. This was submitted to the Open Source Cocktail API DB and is currently being used by 100's of people.**

**It is not mobile friendly/optimized or too responsive, used as a learning experience to expand my knowledge on React. Design idea was uploaded and this will be a work in progress**
